# Turtle Crossing Game

Turtle Crossing Game is an engaging and entertaining Python program that uses the turtle graphics module to create a turtle crossing game similar to the classic game "Frogger." The player controls a turtle and must guide it across a busy road filled with cars. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the player completes each level.

## Features

- Player-controlled turtle character
- Randomly generated cars with varying colors and speeds
- Collision detection between the turtle and cars
- Level progression system with increasing difficulty
- Scoreboard to display the current level and game over message

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics module (usually comes with Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Turtle Crossing Game.

## How to Play

1. Run the Turtle Crossing Game script:

   ```
   python turtle_crossing_game.py
   ```

2. Use the Up arrow key to move the turtle forward.
3. Guide the turtle across the road while avoiding collisions with cars.
4. Once the turtle reaches the top of the screen, the level will increase, and the game will become more challenging.
5. If the turtle collides with a car, the game is over, and a "GAME OVER" message will be displayed.

To restart the game, simply rerun the script.
